![Watermark Segmentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-Click%20Here-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)

Welcome to the **Watermark Segmentation** repository! This project focuses on open-source watermark segmentation developed by **DiffusionDynamics.ai** and **clear.photo**. We leverage deep learning techniques and synthetic data augmentation using PyTorch to accurately detect logos and text. Our aim is to provide a minimal codebase that references top research for robust and adaptable watermark removal.

## Introduction

Watermarks are essential for protecting intellectual property, but they can also hinder the usability of images. This repository aims to solve this problem by providing a deep learning model that can segment and remove watermarks from images effectively. By utilizing synthetic data augmentation, we ensure our model is robust and adaptable to various watermark types.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using PyTorch for high performance and flexibility.
- **Synthetic Data Augmentation**: Enhances model training with diverse data inputs.
- **Robust Performance**: Achieves high accuracy in watermark detection and removal.
- **Minimal Codebase**: Easy to understand and extend for further research.

## Installation

To get started with the Watermark Segmentation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PARAS123413/watermark-segmentation.git
   cd watermark-segmentation
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have PyTorch installed. You can find installation instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Usage

To use the watermark segmentation model, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/PARAS123413/watermark-segmentation/releases). You will find pre-trained models and necessary scripts.

2. Execute the model on your images:

   ```bash
   python segment_watermark.py --input_path path/to/your/image.jpg --output_path path/to/save/segmented_image.jpg
   ```

3. Check the output image to see the watermark removed.

## Model Architecture

Our model is built on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The following diagram illustrates the architecture:

### Key Components

- **Input Layer**: Accepts images with watermarks.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the presence of watermarks.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the segmented image.

## Training

To train the model, you can use the provided training script. Make sure you have your dataset ready.

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path path/to/your/dataset --epochs 50
   ```

3. Monitor the training process and evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, use the evaluation script provided in the repository:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/your/model --test_data_path path/to/test/images
```

This will give you metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's effectiveness.
